# Knowledge Repository
This "knowledge repository" I manage using **ZettelKasten** method with git and gitHub. The concept is simple yet powerful. The ZettelKasten method is attributed to *[Niklas Luhmann](https://luhmann.surge.sh)*, I recommend you to read that to know the concept is.
I'm created this repository highly inspired by *[rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob)* on his [repository](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet). So I created my own version of it :D
